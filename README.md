#  HDP-Flow: Generalizable Bayesian Nonparametric Model for Time Series State Discovery

HDP-Flow is a Bayesian nonparametric model that combines normalizing flows with scalable variational inference to uncover evolving latent states in non-stationary time series. The code in this repo enables efficient, unsupervised state discovery and demonstrates strong performance and transferability across diverse real-world datasets. For more details, please refer to our paper []().

## Prerequisites

All codes are written for Python 3 (https://www.python.org/) on Linux platform. 

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Training the Model
You can train the model using a command like the following:

```
```

You can change the saved model and log file names by modifying the --ext_num parameter.

4. Testing and Evaluation

```
